# Prompt Examples

Profile the new code from the point of view of an expert in mitigating denial-of-service attacks, and to help you update the
code to make sure it is safe from attack and performs well.

## Week 2

Please write a Python function named calcuate_area that takes an argument radius.

The function should calculate the area of a circle given the radius.
Ensure that the function handles non-numeric inputs by raising a
ValueError with the message 'input must be a numeric value'

Include comments in the code explaining each step.
